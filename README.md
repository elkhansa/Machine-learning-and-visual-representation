# Machine-learning-and-visual-representation
In this project different machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the HCP (human connectome project) retinotopy dataset.
The project was part of the neuromatch academy computational neuroscience summer school.
Algorithms used:
1. Linear models (GLM)
2. Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
3. Supervised learning (SVM)
4. Deep learning (CNN)
